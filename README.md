# NGO Student Management (Web Development)
## Background Information
Yasham Foundation is an NGO that deals with the education of
underprivileged students. They partner with coaching institutes from
across the country to offer JEE, NEET, and UPSC coaching as well as regular
classes to underprivileged children. However, there is no system in place
for easy management and assignment of these students to institutes.<br/>
Furthermore, Yasham is entirely run by the efforts and goodwill of its
volunteers who are also students from colleges across India. However,
there is no system to manage this network of volunteers, and the process
of onboarding these volunteers, and handing out certificates and letters of
recommendation is currently completely manual.
## Application Requirements
● There should be a system for management and easy adding of
students to the database. Note that partner schools often share a list
of students in Excel format.
● The portal should be able to manage volunteers, view and track their
achievements/hours, and easily hand out certificates and LORs.
